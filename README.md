# Tilt's VSCode Extension

This extension connects VSCode to Tilt's internal API to display custom data and interact with one's development environment via Tilt.

This is an alpha feature! Please do let us know if you like it, or what you'd like to see on it, or any thoughts you might have. 

And feel free to fork it and create your own extension too! Tilt's API is pretty flexible and it should be easy to adapt this for your own needs.

## Features
